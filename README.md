# Genetic-Analysis-of-Type-2-Diabetes-using-In-Silico-tools
I used In-Silico Tools for Genetic Analysis of Type 2 Diabetes . In-Silico Tools i used were SIFT , POLYPHEN 2 and Fathmm. Calculated probability along with other results which tells us whether an amino acid substitution effects the functioning of Gene related to type 2 diabetes or not.
